    <h2>Html Entities</h2>
    <p>
        HTML entities are special codes or symbols used in HTML to represent characters that have a specific meaning 
        in HTML or that are not easily represented directly in the HTML code. These entities allow you to display characters such as reserved symbols, special characters, and non-standard characters correctly in web pages, regardless of the character encoding used. <br>
        HTML entities are written using an ampersand (&) followed by a specific code or name and ending with a semicolon (;). The basic syntax is as follows: <br>
        &entity_name;
        
    </p>
